Part 2 - Prior Knowledge Question: (Do   this   BEFORE   starting   the   practical.)
The chart below gives the locations, charges,   and   approximate   masses   of three subatomic particles. The approximate mass of each   particle is given   in   universal   mass   units   (u).

1.       The massnumber of an atom is equal to   the   sum   of   protons   and   neutrons   in   the   nucleus.            A helium atom has 2 protons   and   2   neutrons.   What   is   the   mass   number   of this   atom? _____
2.       The atomicnumber of an element   is equal to the number of   protons   in   each atom   of the   element. All   helium atoms have 2 protons. What   is the atomic   number   of   helium? _____
Part 3 – Alpha decay: 
Whilst   most atoms are stable, some are radioactive – this   means they   have   a tendency   to undergo spontaneous nuclear decay. The decay of radioactive atoms will often   result   in   the emission of particles and/or energy. There are 3   main categories   of   radioactive   decay:   alpha   (α),   beta (β), and   gamma   (γ). 
You can explore the first of the radioactive decays   here:

0.       To begin: 
A.      Load up the simulator – note that the first time you   open   it,   it   may take   a   few   minutes   to get started. Open this sim on your web   browser – this may not be iPad compatible so you will need access to a computer/laptop in order for this to work. 
B.      Select “single atom” view and make sure that   polonium-211   is   selected   as the   atom   of choice.
C.    When you are ready,   click “reset all” in   the   bottom   right   corner   to   get   a   fresh   start.
1.  Describe: Using your foundational knowledge, describe the following characteristics: 
What is the atomic   mass of   Polonium-211   have?    
Using a periodic table, calculate the following: 
How   many protons does   Polonium-211 have?    
How   many neutrons does   Polonium-211 have?    
2. After polonium-211 decays, what stable nucleus   is formed?   
Has the atomic   number changed? What about the atomic   mass?
3. Pause the simulation immediately after the decay occurs.   What   is   being   emitted   by   the   polonium-211 nucleus? (There are 2   emissions). 
What is the   particle emission   made   of?
_________________________________________________________________________
4.       Click ‘ reset all’ and   run the simulation again – what   is the   half life of a   polonium-211   atom?
5. Calculate: Look at the following equation below. What you see is the original polonium atom on the left. The boxes on the right represent the daughter product—the atom produced by radioactive decay—and the emitted particle.

Using your understanding from the questions above, fill in the blanks with the daughter product and the emitted particle.
Next, click on Multiple Atoms in the simulation. Add all 100 polonium-211 nuclei to the simulation by adding 10 nuclei to the simulation at a time under the Bucket o’ Polonium. Once you have all 100 added, click on Reset All Nuclei. 
6. After you click on Reset All Nuclei, the simulation starts over again. By when do you expect most of the polonium-211 nuclei to decay?

8. Click ‘reset all   nuclei’   , and pause the simulator after   every   0.5   seconds.   Note the   number   of   polonium-211 nuclei   present.   Fill   in the data chart   below, and create   a graph   of   polonium-211 nuclei versus   time.

What shape does this graph have?   Does the polonium-211   decay   at   a   constant   rate   or   does   the   rate decrease over time?

Part 4 – Beta decay: 
Next, we will   be looking at a secondary type of decay   known   as   beta decay. You   can   explore   beta decays   here:

B.      Select “single atom” view and make sure that   carbon-14   is   selected   as the   atom   of   choice.

Has the atomic   number changed? What about the atomic   mass?
3. Pause the simulation immediately after the decay occurs. What is being emitted by the carbon-14 nucleus? (There are 3 emissions).

The particle emission comes from the breakdown of a neutron into a proton – explain this process:

6. There are 2 other forms   of beta decay:   beta-plus decay, and   electron   capture.
A. Explain   how   beta plus decay is different from what we just saw in   the   carbon-14   decay. (Describe the difference in   process and   in   emissions).

B. Using the internet, see if you can find   an example   of   beta   plus   decay –   draw   out   the reaction as you   have for   question 4.
